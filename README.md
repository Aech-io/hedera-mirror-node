# Beta Mirror Node

This BetaMirrorNode implementation supports CryptoService, FileService and SmartContractService through a proxy.
It can also parse the RecordStream and balance files generated by Hedera nodes.

## Description

Beta mirror node is a temporary mirror node implementation until the Hedera Mirrornet and associated Mirror Nodes receiving gossip about gossip are available.

The Beta mirror node works as follows:

- When a transaction reaches consensus, Hedera nodes add the transaction and its associated record to a record file.
- The file is closed on a regular cadence and a new file is created for the next batch of transactions and records. The interval is currently set to 1 minute but may vary between networks.
- Once the file is closed, nodes generate a signature file which contains the signature generated by the node for the record file.
- Record files also contain the hash of the previous record file, thus creating an unbreakable validation chain.

- The signature and record files are then uploaded from the nodes to Amazon S3 and Google File Storage.

- This mirror node software downloads signature files from either S3 or Google File Storage.
- The signature files are validated to ensure more than 2/3 of the nodes in the address book (stored in a `0.0.102` file) have the same signature.
- For each valid signature file, the corresponding record file is then downloaded from the cloud.
- Record files can then be processed and transactions and records processed for long term storage.

- In addition, nodes regularly generate a balance file which contains the list of Hedera accounts and their corresponding balance which is also uploaded to S3 and Google File Storage.
- The files are also signed by the nodes.
- This mirror node software can download the balance files, validate 2/3rd of nodes have signed and then process the balance files for long term storage.

## Prerequisites

This mirror node beta requires Java version 10.

## Compile from source code

Run `mvn install -DskipTests` from the `MirrorNode` directory.

This will compile a runnable mirror node jar file in the `target` directory and copy sample `nodesInfo.json.sample`, `config.json.sample` and `log4j2.xml` files into the same directory.

`cd target`

## Changes history

Besides bug fixes, some features may have changed with this release which need your attention, these will be listed here.

### Addition of a REST api

A REST api written in `node` is now available in this project.

### Switched from individual docker containers to `docker-compose`

See below for instructions

### Creation of a database version table

Added version numbering to the database to make upgrades easier.
The `t_version` table contains the current version of the database.
The upgrade scripts only apply changes that pertain to the current version of the database and update it when complete.

### Additional columns in `t_entities`

Added columns to t_entities to record expiry time, autorenew period, keys and proxy account.

### Database URL as environment parameter

The connection to the database can be specified as an environment variable `HEDERA_MIRROR_DB_URL` or specified via a `.env.` file.

### Added optional persistence of crypto transfers, file contents, contract creation and call results and claim data

See section on configuration for additional details.

### Addition of `stopLoggingIfHashMismatch` configuration item

When processing files after they have been downloaded, this flag will determine whether file processing should continue or stop in the event of a mismatch between the hash of the last file processed and the hash held for the previous file in the file being processed.

If set to `true` : Any mismatch in the sequence of file hashes will bring the processing to a stop, the missing file has to be downloaded in order for processing to be able to continue.
If set to `false`: Hash sequence mismatches will be logged but ignored and processing will continue until there are no files to process.

A file called `loggerStatus.json` will be created in the `./config` folder containing the hash of the last successfully processed file.

### `node-log` has been removed from `log4.xml`

All logging now goes to a single recordStream-log

### Addition of `maxDownloadItems` parameter in config.json file

For testing purposes, this value may be set to a number other than 0. This will limit the number of downloaded files accordingly. If set to 0, all files are downloaded from S3 or GCP.

### Addition of a `postgresUpdate.sql` script

This script contains the incremental changes to the database in the event you need to upgrade an older version of the database to the current version.

### The `t_account_balance_history` table has a new `seconds` column

The `seconds` column contains the number of seconds since epoch in addition to the `snapshot_time` which is a `timestamp`, both contain the same value in different formats.

### Loggers now return true/false depending on success/failure to log

Before this change, failure to log wasn't detected by the class calling the logger which resulted in files being moved when they shouldn't be.

### Addition of cloud storage as an alternative to AWS

It is now possible to specify that files are downloaded from Google Compute Platform storage instead of Amazon S3.
The switch is enabled via the `config/config.json` file.

### Removal of command line arguments

All configuration parameters are now sourced from `./config/config.json` by default, it no longer needs to be specified on the command line.

### Inclusion of logging to PostgreSQL database

The `recordFileLogger`, `balanceFileHistoryLogger` and `balanceFileLogger` write transactions, records and balances to a PostgreSQL database. The scripts for creating the database are provided in the `postreSQL` folder.

### Amazon Hedera S3 access keys

Access and secret keys to Hedera's Amazon S3 bucket may now be specified via environment variables or a `./.env` file

### Configuration files

All configuration files now reside in the `./config` folder.

### new `Config.json` `downloadPeriodSec` parameter

If set to 0, the downloader will download available files and exit.
If set to another value, the downloader will download available files, wait `downloadPeriodSec` and start downloading new files again until it is stopped by the operator (`kill or ctrl-c`).

### Logging

Previous versions of the mirror node software embedded a `log4j2.xml` file in the jar, this is no longer the case, so by default, no logging will take place.
Should you wish to enable logging, copy the `log4j2.xml` file from `src/main/resources` or `target` to the same location as the `mirrorNode.jar` file, edit accordingly and include the following in your `java` command:

```shell
    -Dlog4j.configurationFile=./log4j2.xml
```

for example

```shell
    java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=./log4j2.xml -cp mirrorNode.jar com.hedera.recordFileParser.RecordFileParser
```

This will ensure that the `log4j2.xml` file is used to direct logging accordingly.

If you do not specify a `log4j2.xml`, the following error will be output but will not prevent the software from operating.

```code
ERROR StatusLogger No Log4j 2 configuration file found. Using default configuration (logging only errors to the console), or user programmatically provided configurations. Set system property 'log4j2.debug' to show Log4j 2 internal initialization logging. See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html for instructions on how to configure Log4j 2
```

## Setup your environment

The build process has copied sample files to the `target/config` or the `/runtime/config` folder depending on whether you are running locally or via `docker-compose`.

- `nodesInfo.json.sample` - rename this file to `nodesInfo.json` and edit so that the appropriate nodes are listed.
- `config.json.sample` - rename this file to `config.json` and edit so that the configuration parameters that are appropriate to your environment are setup. See section below on configuration file specifics.

- the file prefixed with '0.0.102' is the contents of a file hosted on Hedera with file ID `0.0.102`. This file contains the address book from the Hedera network which lists nodes and their public keys for signature verification purposes. Ensure the appropriate one for your network is identified in the `config.json` file (addressBookFile entry) otherwise signature verification will fail.

Pay close attention to the contents of these configuration files, they directly affect how the mirror node operates.

### nodesInfo.json

This file contains the list of nodes for which you want to download files from and the list of nodes which the proxy can send transactions to.

For example:

```json
{
  "0.0.3": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 50211
  },
  "0.0.4": {
    "host": "127.0.0.2",
    "port": 50211
  },
  "0.0.5": {
    "host": "127.0.0.3",
    "port": 50211
  },
  "0.0.6": {
    "host": "127.0.0.4",
    "port": 50211
  }
}
```

Edit the `./config/nodesInfo.json` file to match the nodes on the network you are running mirror node against.

### 0.0.102 file

The `0.0.102` file contains the address book, that is the list of nodes, their account number and public key(s). This file is different on every network so it is imperative to ensure you have the correct one for each network, else the signature verification process will fail.
See instructions below on how to generate this file for a network.

### config.json

| Parameter name  | Default value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| cloud-provider | `"S3"` | Either `S3` or `GCP` depending on where you want to download files from |

| persistContracts | `true` | Determines whether contract data is persisted to the database or not |
| persistCryptoTransferAmounts | `true` | Determines whether crypto transfer amount data is persisted to the database or not |

The following environment variables may be used instead of values in the `config.json` file for additional security.
Environment variables if set will take precedence over values in the `config.json` file.
Environment variables may be set through the command line `export varname=value` or via a `.env` file located in the folder where the java classes are executed from

Note: this requires additional information to be stored in the `config.json`, `.env` or environment variables as follows:

| json parameter name | corresponding environment variable |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| dbUsername | HEDERA_MIRROR_DB_USER |
| dbPassword | HEDERA_MIRROR_DB_PASS |
| accessKey | HEDERA_S3_ACCESS_KEY |
| secretKey | HEDERA_S3_SECRET_KEY |


Sample `./.env` file.

```text
HEDERA_S3_ACCESS_KEY=accessKey
HEDERA_S3_SECRET_KEY=secretKey
```

### loggerStatus.json

This isn't strictly speaking a configuration file, it is created at runtime by the mirror node software and holds the hash of the last successfully parsed file. It is held in a separate file to `config.json` to ensure downloads and processing don't overwrite each-other's changes.

## Installing the database

Ensure you have a postgreSQL server running (versions 10 and 11 have been tested) with the mirror node software.

Log into the database as an administrator and run the `postgres/postgresInit.sql` script to create the database and necessary entities.

Ensure you change the default values in the first few lines of this script to match your environment.

```sql
\set db_name hederamirror
\set db_user hederamirror
\set db_password mysecretpassword
```

By default, this installation script creates a new database called `hederamirror`, with a user named `hederamirror` and a default password of `mysecretpassword`. Make the necessary changes to the script should you wish to use different values (and update the `config/config.json` or `.env` or environment variables accordingly).
Check the output of the script carefully to ensure no errors occurred.

## Upgrading the database

If you have already installed the database and wish to upgrade it, you may run the `postgres/postgresUpdate.sql` script against your database.

Ensure you change the default values in the first few lines of this script to match your environment.

```sql
\set db_name hederamirror
\set db_user hederamirror
\set db_password mysecretpassword
```

Check the output of the script carefully to ensure no errors occurred.

## Running the various mirror node components

### Note about error when running the software

The error below may appear on the console when running the `.jar` file, this is normal and nothing to be concerned about.

```code
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.google.protobuf.UnsafeUtil (file:/home/greg/mirrornode/lib/protobuf-java-3.5.1.jar) to field java.nio.Buffer.address
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of com.google.protobuf.UnsafeUtil
WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
```

### To Run BetaMirrorNode Proxy

*Note: The beta mirror node proxy doesn't select nodes by itself, rather it inspects the transactions it receives, extracts the target node information from the transaction (`NodeAccountID` from `transactionBody`) and forwards the transaction to this node.*

Run the following command:

```shell
java -jar mirrorNode.jar
```

### To Download RecordStream file(s)

Run the following command:

```shell
java -cp mirrorNode.jar com.hedera.downloader.RecordFileDownloader
```

Record files and signature files will be downloaded from S3 to the location specified in the `config.json` file.

### To Download Balance file(s)

Run the following command:

```shell
java -cp mirrorNode.jar com.hedera.downloader.AccountBalancesDownloader
```

Balance files will be downloaded from S3 to the location specified in the `config.json` file.

Example file

```text
year,month,day,hour,minute,second
2019,JUNE,28,17,29,17
shard,realm,number,balance
0,0,1,0
0,0,2,4530999689861900540
... continues
```

### To Parse RecordStream file(s)

Run the following command:

```shell
java -cp mirrorNode.jar com.hedera.recordFileParser.RecordFileParser
```

### To Parse Balance file(s)

This project provides two balance file parsing and logging options.

- Log only the latest balance - looks for the latest balance file and stores the balances in the database
- Log balances with timestamp history - loads every available balance file and stores account balances against the file's timestamp.

Note: You can run both, however it is **imperative** that 'latest' is run prior to 'history' since history moves files to a processed folder, thereby removing any files for 'latest' to process.

To parse and log the latest files, run the following command:

```shell
java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=./log4j2.xml -cp mirrorNode.jar com.hedera.balanceFileLogger.BalanceFileLogger 
```

To parse and log balances with history, run the following command:

```shell
java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=./log4j2.xml -cp mirrorNode.jar com.hedera.balanceFileLogger.BalanceFileHistoryLogger 
```

### To Send Transactions or Queries to the BetaMirrorNode Proxy

Using a client which is able to generate and send transactions to a Hedera node, update the configuration of the client application such that it sends its transactions to the proxy host and port instead of a Hedera node.

## Docker compose

Follow instructions above for setting up the `config.json` file. And edit the `.env` file in the `docker` folder to ensure environment variables are set correctly.

example `.env` file.

```text
POSTGRES_DB=hederamirror
POSTGRES_USER=hederamirror
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
```

If this is the first time you run the environment (or during a rebuild of the containers) in `docker-compose` you will need to update the `postgres/postgresInit.sql` script's fires few lines to set the database name, user and password you wish to use.

```sql
\set db_name hederamirror
\set db_user hederamirror
\set db_password mysecretpassword
```

Containers use persisted volumes as follows:

- `./MirrorNodePostgresData` on your local machine maps to `/var/lib/postgresql/data` in the containers. This contains the files for the Postgres database.
- `./runtime` on your local machine maps to `/MirrorNodeCode` in the containers. This contains the runtime and configuration files for loading and parsing files.
- `./MirrorNodeData` on your local machine maps to `/MirrorNodeData` in the containers. This contains files downloaded from S3 or GCP.

These are necessary not only for the database data to be persisted, but also so that the parsing containers can access file obtained via the downloading containers

Docker compose scripts are available in the `docker` folder. A `buildImages.sh` script ensures the necessary data is available to the images via volumes, builds the images and starts the containers.

Note: Shutting down the database container via `docker-compose down` may result in a corrupted database that may not restart or may take longer than usual to restart.

In order to avoid this, shell into the container and issue the following command:

Use `docker ps` to get the name of the database container, it should be something like `mirror-node-postgres`.

Use the command `docker exec -it <container name> /bin/sh` to get a shell in the container.

`su - postgres -c "PGDATA=$PGDATA /usr/local/bin/pg_ctl -w stop"`

You may now power down the docker image itself.

## Creating the address book file (0.0.102 file)

The java code below was used with the java SDK in order to create the file.

```java
package com.hedera.hashgraph.sdk.examples.advanced;

import com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException;
import com.hedera.hashgraph.sdk.HederaException;
import com.hedera.hashgraph.sdk.examples.ExampleHelper;
import com.hedera.hashgraph.sdk.file.FileId;
import com.hedera.hashgraph.sdk.file.FileContentsQuery;

import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public final class GetHederaAddressBook {
    private GetHederaAddressBook() { }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws HederaException, InvalidProtocolBufferException {

        // Build the Hedera client using ExampleHelper class
        var client = ExampleHelper.createHederaClient();

        // Get file contents
        var contents = new FileContentsQuery(client)
            .setFileId(new FileId(0, 0, 102))
            .execute();
        try {
            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("0.0.102");
            fos.write(contents.getFileContents().getContents().toByteArray());
            fos.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## REST API

A REST API to the database is available under `rest-api`.

To start it, `cd rest-api` then `npm install`.

Create a `.env` file as per below and run with `npm start`.

You can also unittest using jest by using `npm test`.

example `.env` file:

```TEXT
DB_HOST='localhost'
DB_USER='hederamirror'
DB_PASS='mysecretpassword'
DB_NAME='hederamirror'
PORT=5551
```

`PORT` is the port number the REST API will listen onto.

## Notes about the java project structure

The java project contains a number of packages and classes for its various modes of operation

- com.hedera.mirrorNodeProxy

Contains a `MirrorNodeProxy` class which is responsible for running the proxy.

- com.hedera.downloader

Contains a `RecordFileDownloader` class which connects to an s3 bucket and downloads record files from the bucket.

Contains a `AccountBalancesDownloader` class which connects to an s3 bucket and downloads account balance files from the bucket.

- com.hedera.recordFileParser

Contains a `RecordFileParser` class which given a number of record files will process them, it calls the static class below which is responsible for processing the output itself.

- com.hedera.recordFileLogger

Contains a `RecordFileLogger` class which is an example of how to receive transactions and records from `RecordFileParser` and output to a text file. It is recommended you modify this class for your purposes while leaving the other packages and classes untouched so that future updates do not impact your own development

`RecordFileLogger` contains the following public methods:

- public static void start()

Called whenever the `RecordFileParser` class starts running.

- public static void finish()

Called whenever the `RecordFileParser` class ends running.

- public static void initFile(String fileName)

Called whenever a new file starts processing

- public static void completeFile()

Called whenever a file completes processing

- public static void storeRecord(long counter, Instant consensusTimeStamp, Transaction transaction, TransactionRecord txRecord)

Called for each record found in the record files such that you can decide whether to store that transaction and its record in your own files or database.

- public static void storeSignature(String signature)

Called for each signature that is processed.
